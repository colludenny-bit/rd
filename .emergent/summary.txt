<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a highly sophisticated and dynamic trading dashboard called Ascolta IA with a zen black and gold/green aesthetic. The dashboard should be an all-encompassing Trading OS that not only displays data but actively assists the trader through AI-driven insights, psychological tracking, and strategy analysis.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **UI/UX**:
  - Dark, minimalist, Apple-like style with fluid animations.
  - A main sidebar for navigation (Home, Report, News, Risk, Statistics, Strategy, Monte Carlo, Psychology, Journal, AI, Community).
  - A central content area that displays the active section.
  - Interactive elements like expandable cards for market analysis.
  - Theme (light/dark) and language (IT, EN, FR) switchers.
- **Core Pages & Features**:
  - **Home (Dashboard)**: A summary view with a greeting, a philosophical quote, and an AI Macro Desk that provides hourly directional analysis for XAU, NAS100, SP500, EURUSD based on a complex model using VIX, macro data, news sentiment, and COT reports.
  - **Report**: An AI-driven strategy analysis page. It should evaluate predefined trading strategies (News Spike Reversion, VIX-Regime Range Fade) and generate daily signals with probabilities, entry/stop/target levels, and 2-hourly updates.
  - **News**: An interactive TradingView economic calendar widget with custom filters for importance and country.
  - **Risk**: A VIX-based risk dashboard that calculates a daily Risk Score (0-100) based on VIX level, momentum, economic events, and market stretch. It must also provide per-asset risk analysis.
  - **Strategy**: A page to manage, create, and define custom trading strategies. Each strategy should have an option to be exported and run in the Monte Carlo simulation.
  - **Statistics**: A page to upload PDF reports for analysis, with an option to export results to the Monte Carlo simulation.
  - **Monte Carlo**: A simulation page that takes strategy parameters (from Strategy or Statistics pages) and runs simulations.
  - **Psychology & Journal**: Pages for daily psychological check-ins, sleep tracking, and journaling trade errors and lessons, with AI providing feedback.
  - **AI & Community**: Pages for a central AI chat and a community feed for sharing trades.
- **Integrations**:
  - **TradingView**: For charts and the news/economic calendar widget. User wants to connect their personal account.
  - **AI**: An AI coach that learns from user patterns and provides advice. This involves significant backend data processing.
- **Authentication**: Email/Password and social logins (Google/Apple).

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application foundation is in place with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. User authentication (email/password) is functional. The overall UI layout, including a highly customized sidebar, multi-page routing, dark theme, and i18n setup, has been built. Many pages exist as components (, , , , ,  etc.), but most of the complex business logic described by the user has just been added as static JSX content without backend integration. The  has a functional TradingView economic calendar widget. The other complex pages were just overwritten with new static UI based on the user's latest, very detailed requirements.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the process of implementing the user's detailed specifications for several core pages. The user provided extensive, complex requirements for the **Home** (AI Macro Desk), **Report** (Strategy Analysis), **Risk** (VIX Score), **Strategy** (Management), and **Statistics** (PDF Analysis) pages. The agent overwrote the corresponding frontend files (, , , ) to reflect the new UI structure. It was about to start on the  changes when the last message came in.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0): Incomplete Implementation of Core AI Features:** The agent has created the UI scaffolding for the , , , and  pages, but the complex data processing, calculations, and AI logic are not implemented. The UI is static and not connected to any backend services. A previous attempt to view a newly overwritten page resulted in an error, indicating the code is likely broken.

  - **Attempted fixes:** The agent overwrote the page components with JSX representing the final UI. This is not a fix, but the first step of the implementation.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  **Backend First:** The immediate priority is to build the backend endpoints required for these features. Start with the  page as it has self-contained logic (VIX calculations).
        -   Create a new API endpoint in , e.g., .
        -   This endpoint needs to fetch real-time VIX data, economic calendar events, and market prices for the required assets.
        -   Implement the  calculation logic as specified by the user in Python.
        -   Return the calculated data as a JSON response.
    2.  **Frontend Integration:**
        -   In , use  and  to call the new  endpoint.
        -   Store the response in a state variable (e.g., ).
        -   Replace the static data in the JSX with the dynamic data from the state.
    3.  **Repeat for other pages:** Follow the same Backend -> Frontend integration pattern for , , and .
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the core of the user's request. Fixing this will transform the application from a static UI mockup into the dynamic, AI-powered Trading OS the user wants.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
  - **Blocked on other issue:** No.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1 (P0): Implement AI Macro Desk on Home Page:**
  - **Where to resume:** The user has provided detailed specs for the AI Macro Desk. The agent needs to overwrite  to include the new UI for this feature (interactive cards for each asset showing probability, impulse, drivers). This will require creating new backend endpoints to perform the complex calculations involving VIX, macro data, news, and COT reports.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The dashboard's main page will become dynamic and provide the core hourly analysis the user requested.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
  - **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **P1: Full Backend Implementation:** Build all necessary API endpoints in  to support the AI features on the Home, Report, and Risk pages. This includes fetching and processing VIX, COT reports, economic calendar data, and real-time prices.
  - **P1: Strategy & Monte Carlo Page Integration:** Implement the functionality to define a strategy on the , export it to the , and run a simulation.
  - **P2: TradingView Personal Account Integration:** Investigate and implement a way for users to connect their own TradingView accounts to see their saved charts.

-    and : Defines the color palette (black and green) and global styles.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The new complex pages (, , , ) currently have large blocks of static JSX. As backend data is integrated, these should be broken down into smaller, reusable components to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (POST) User registration.
-   : (POST) User login.
-   : (GET) Fetches current user details.
-   **Needed:**
    -   : To provide data for the Risk page.
    -   : To provide data for the Report page.
    -   : To provide data for the AI Macro Desk on the Home page.
    -   And many more for journal, psychology, etc.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is very specific and provides extremely detailed, technical instructions for features. Read their requests carefully.
- The immediate task is to transition from building static UI to implementing the complex backend logic and integrating it with the frontend.
- Prioritize building the backend functionality first, then connect the frontend. Do not attempt to build all features at once. Tackle one page at a time (e.g., Risk Page -> Report Page -> Home Page).
- The user's language is Italian. All responses must be in Italian.
